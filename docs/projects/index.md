## Experience

----------

**Keywords**

* Computer vision and big data
* C++ modern programming
* Full-stack application


My experience can be divided into two major sections: Machine learning and Software Development.

Back in 2019 when I was in Munich, I joined the deep computer vision lab to work with kalman filter variations. 
I expanded my object re-identification and tracking experience starting in 2021 at Columbia. 
I first got started with VAE-(W)GAN to generate synthetic images and label smoothing with outliers(CVPR 2017) and poly-loss(ICLR 2022). 
In early 2022, I joined Kostic lab for a while to investigate BoTs in self-supervised re-identifications with model zoos, both in pedestrian and vehicles, and at the same time, to build a machine learning pipeline with data auto-fetch by tuned YoloV4.
I applied my experience in NVIDIA metropolis team in 2022 summer, and integrated the algorithm into a streaming data pipeline.

I also have experience in high-performance software development. 
I started with CUDA programming to accelerate KMeans with a single GPU. 
I got in touch with model quantization at Columbia and also participated in Megvii's mini-workshop and gained first place. In late 2022, I developed faster multi-GPU training on both CNN and transformer models. 
I also tried to adapt to C++20's new features, multi-threading, and concurrency in my recent full-stack development based on the course taught by Prof. Stroustrup. 

Projects cover a wide range of topics, where you can get access to the details through [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperbTUM) as well as my [CV](https://superbTUM.github.io/resume).
