## A Few Words About Me

------

<img src="../../images/timeline.png" width="100%"/>

<img src="../../images/location_icon.jpg" width="4%"/> Hello from New York City & Salt Lake City!


-----------------------
I started my overseas study in 2019 at the international summer school at PolyU @ HK, where I took elementary courses on artificial intelligence, and got a chance to play with AzureML. 
After that, I became an exchange student in my senior year at the department of computer science, TUM @ Germany, where I involved myself in both VLSI design and deep computer vision lab. 
The lab was kind of tough, with only four members that semester. 
I was assigned the task of multiple object tracking across cameras.

I successfully reproduced a paper in 2020, on Megvii's challenge, and I am glad that I earned a few stars on GitHub. 
Reproduction is not just simply copying code from somewhere else, it's also an experiment, assessment and deep understanding of the paper.

-----------------------
During my master's study at Columbia, I joined the Kostic lab for a while with Prof. Zoran Kostic, on smart intersection topics, primarily focusing on unsupervised person and vehicle re-identification, as labeling is likely to be restricted by privacy. 
I expanded my experience further at NVIDIA Metropolis, during the following summer break, and my work was presented by Milind Naphade, CTO of Metropolis, at the GTC summit 2022.
I will publish a self-research paper on mobile person re-identification solution soon.

I worked as a teaching assistant in the department of computer science and electrical engineering for three times. 
Mentoring makes me a better communicator and writer.

------------------------
While AI is my area of interest all the time, I also dive into data science and full-stack development. 
I won a few top rankings in machine learning and data science challenges. 
In February, I won the best beginner hack @ Columbia Hack.

I have experience with API design, microservices on cloud, web crawler and streaming processing.

As a recall, I would like to list my technical stacks below:
