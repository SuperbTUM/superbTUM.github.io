## About Me

<img src="images/timeline.png" width="100%" style="margin: 20px 0;"/>

<img src="images/location_icon.jpg" width="4%"/> Hello from New York City & Salt Lake City!

I started my overseas study in 2019 at the international summer school at PolyU @ HK, where I took elementary courses on artificial intelligence, and got a chance to play with AzureML. After that, I became an exchange student in my senior year at the department of computer science, TUM @ Germany, where I involved myself in both VLSI design and deep computer vision lab.

During my master's study at Columbia, I joined the Kostic lab for a while with Prof. Zoran Kostic, on smart intersection topics, primarily focusing on unsupervised person and vehicle re-identification. I expanded my experience further at NVIDIA Metropolis, during the following summer break, and my work was presented by Milind Naphade, CTO of Metropolis, at the GTC summit 2022.

Currently working as a full-time software engineer at SoFi, where I apply my expertise in AI/ML and full-stack development to build scalable financial technology solutions.
